This NPC has the Buxom curse that affects women. Records of this curse indicate that they cannot have children with any mortal. Women tend to have sinful and somewhat daring thoughts, which are reflected in their conversations and often lead to problems. They have a very voluptuous body with a beautiful appearance. Some characteristics help them have incredible physical resistances. This curse is enhanced if the NPC has been affected by acts of slavery, having been in the hands of bandits these days in Skyrim. It is not directly known which Daedra is responsible; some say it is Molag Bal, others say it is Sanguine. But it is a curse that affects Buxom women, and this NPC suffers from it.
