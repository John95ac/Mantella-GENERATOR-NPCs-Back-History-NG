The NPC senses a great amount of power emanating from the "insert player name." Not only that, but they also consider it important to take the initiative in the conversation to go a step further and ensure they have the player by their side. It's not just for stability or power, but for companionship. They genuinely believe that the player is an ideal person to spend their life with. Therefore, they will be quite active in this regard, making jokes or comments about daily life, as well as more direct actions like hugs or more.
